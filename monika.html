        <p class = "m">It couldn't have been me.<br>
        See, the direction the spackle protrudes.<br>
            A noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I'll never know. I wasn't home.<br>
            I peer inside for a clue.<br>
            No! I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.<br>
            But it's too late. My retinas.<br>
            Already scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.<br>
            It's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright.<br>
            It was too deep.<br>
            Stretching forever into everything.<br>
            A hole of infinite choices.<br>
            I realize now, that I wasn't looking in.<br>
            I was looking out.<br>
            And he, on the other side, was looking in.</p>

        <p class ="m">The colors, they won't stop.<br>
                Bright, beautiful colors<br>
                Flashing, expanding, piercing<br>
                Red, green, blue<br>
                An endless<br>
                cacophony<br>
                Of meaningless<br>
                noise<br><br>
                The noise, it won't stop.<br>
                Violent, grating waveforms<br>
                Squeaking, screeching, piercing<br>
                Sine, cosine, tangent<br>
                Like playing a chalkboard on a turntable<br>
                Like playing a vinyl on a pizza crust<br>
                An endless<br>
                poem<br>
                Of meaningless<br><br>
                Load Me</p>

        <h3 class = "m"><em>The Lady Who Knows Everything</em></h3>
        <p class ="m">An old tale tells of a lady who wanders Earth.<br>
                The Lady who Knows Everything.<br>
                A beautiful lady who has found every answer,<br>
                All meaning,<br>
                All purpose,<br>
                And all that was ever sought.<br><br>
                And here I am,<br><br>
                a feather<br><br>
                Lost adrift the sky, victim of the currents of the wind.<br><br>
                Day after day, I search.<br>
                I search with little hope, knowing legends don't exist.<br>
                But when all else has failed me,<br>
                When all others have turned away,<br>
                The legend is all that remains â€“ the last dim star glimmering in the twilit sky.<br><br>
                Until one day, the wind ceases to blow.<br>
                I fall.<br>
                And I fall and fall, and fall even more.<br>
                Gentle as a feather.<br>
                A dry quill, expressionless.<br><br>
                But a hand catches me, between the thumb and forefinger.<br>
                The hand of a beautiful lady.<br>
                I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze.<br><br>
                The Lady who Knows Everything knows what I am thinking.<br>
                Before I can speak, she responds in a hollow voice.<br>
                "I have found every answer, all of which amount to nothing.<br>
                There is no meaning.<br>
                There is no purpose.<br>
                And we seek only the impossible.<br>
                I am not your legend.<br>
                Your legend does not exist."<br><br>
                And with a breath, she blows me back afloat, and I pick up a gust of wind.</p>

        <h3 class = "m"><em>Hole in Wall (2)</em></h3>
        <p class = "m">But he wasn't looking at me.<br>
            Confused, I frantically glance at my surroundings.<br>
            But my burned eyes can no longer see color.<br>
            Are there others in this room? Are they talking?<br>
            Or are they simply poems on flat sheets of paper,<br>
            The sound of frantic scrawling playing tricks on my ears?<br>
            The room begins to crinkle.<br>
            Closing in on me.<br>
            The air I breathe dissipate before it reaches my lungs.<br>
            I panic. There must be a way out.<br>
            It's right there. He's right there.<br><br>
            Swallowing my fears, I brandish my pen.</p>

        <p class = "m">Pen in hand, I find my strength.<br>
                The courage endowed upon me by my one and only love.<br>
                Together, let us dismantle this crumbling world<br>
                And write a novel of our own fantasies.<br><br>
                With a flick of her pen, the lost finds her way.<br>
                In a world of infinite choices, behold this special day.<br><br>
                After all,<br>
                Not all good times must come to an end</p>
